                A great restaurant website can attract new customers, maintain loyal ones, and raise the overall profile
                of the establishment outside of the physical location.

                But how do you put together a great website when you - the restaurant owner or operator - are busy with
                the many other critical tasks related to running your restaurant?

                Well, building the best restaurant website doesn’t have to be a time-consuming or difficult task. In
                many cases, there are simple things you can build into your website to share the most important
                information with your frequent and potential guests.

                Check out 12 of our favorite restaurant websites, each paired with a pro tip that explains what makes
                them stand out. Further down, you can find a slideshow of Toast's 50 best restaurant websites if you
                need even more inspiration. A great restaurant website can attract new customers, maintain loyal ones,

            <p>Many restaurants will run events throughout the week - like
                Happy Hours - to keep customers coming back at specific, perhaps low traffic, times. This is great
                content to add to your website to make sure new guests know about the unique things happening at your
                establishment. Olympia Oyster Bar in Portland, OR has an Upcoming Events section up top, and if you
                scroll down, you'll find their Weekly Happenings section, as well as more
                info about their events. </p>
